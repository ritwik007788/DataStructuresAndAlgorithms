Types of Binary trees 

1.) Perfect Binary Tree

All nodes can have either 2 children on no child. The leaf nodes must be on the same left(i.e the last level is only leaf nodes)

to check for perfect binary tree  -  if the height of the tree is h. Then the total no. of nodes in the tree will be 2^(h+1) - 1 or Math.pow(2,h+1) - 1 .


2.) Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
i.e all the levels are completeley filled and in the last level leaves are filled from left direction(but the last level may or may not be completeley filled).

to check complete binary tree - the children of the node at index i is at 2*i+1(left child) and 2*i+2(right child).So we count the no. of nodes and 
                                check wether the child node is present in the total no. of nodes.
                                

3.)Full Binary tree

All nodes can either have 0 or 2 children. (level doesn't matter here)
